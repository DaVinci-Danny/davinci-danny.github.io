  <p> <strong>Energy is more than what we measure in volts</strong>. It surrounds everything. Energy is easy to find but difficult to harvest and transform into the familiar little battery icon in the corner of your iPhone. The problem is taking this energy that is in everything and making it useable. There are sustainable ways of doing this, we have wind power solar, hydro, geothermal and more, but we keep turning to destructive fossil fuels.<br><br>Every part of the cycle for making energy from fossil fuels is destructive. To find it you must first rip apart the area you are mining destroying habitats. This also means that you must have lots of machines to transport the materials you mine. Then you must burn it. This is the worst part, we pump over 35 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere(CBS, 2017). This causes polar caps to melt, temperatures to rise, animals are forced out of their habitats if they are not choked to death first. The oceans become acidified as CO2 dissolves into the ocean bleaching reefs, killing fish.<br><br>But there must be something we can do. Unfortunately even if we stop all today there will still be billions of tons of CO2 in the air slowly destroying the planet for years to come. We need a solution and fast.<br><img src="images/coalplant2.jpg" alt="A coal plant" class="home"><br></p>
  <h4>What I Plan To Do</h4>
