  <p class="introd">It is clear from the results that the hypothesis is correct, and that electronic products do indeed damage the planet negatively. This is because the chemicals within electronic components are damaging to the cells of plants, meaning that they cannot grow at their normal rates. The experiment was done over an admittedly quite short which led to results that, although clear donâ€™t look at first glance to be very significant. As I stated within the results though after the experiment time period ended, the variant plant died whilst the control plant stayed healthy and continued to grow (It sits on my window sill looking very pretty). This is a very serious problem though. Electronics are very often dumped into landfill where their electronic components can leak into the soil permanently damaging the surrounding soil.<br><br>The implications of this issue are widespread, electronics are extremely common and when we are done with them they have to go somewhere. I can safely conclude from my research that the production and usage of electronics damages the environment in unprecedented ways, and that we should do whatever is in our power to limit or stop contamination.<br><br>      Electronics have severe, lasting effects on the environment and if you care for the planet you must do what you can to limit or stop your footprint.<p>
